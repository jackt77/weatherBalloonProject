# Weather Balloon Project – Code Repository

Hi All,
This repository is our central hub for anything code-related in the weather balloon project.

## Purpose
If it involves software, automation, modelling, analysis, or anything we don’t want lost on someone’s laptop, it belongs here.

This includes:
* Onboard Software – *Code that will run on the payload*
* Prediction & Simulation – *Scripts for flight path prediction, collecting weather data, etc.*
* *Any other code or anything else code-related that may be useful to have in one place we can all access*
